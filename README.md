# 🎬 Movie_Tutorial

This is a simple movie browsing application built with **React** and the **OMDB API**. Users can search for movies, view basic information, and add or remove favourites. The app has two main pages: a home page for searching and browsing movies, and a favourites page that shows all selected movies.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-movie-app.git
   cd react-movie-app

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   
3. **Get an OMDB API key:**

  Visit http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
  Sign up for a free API key

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## 📌 Notes

The OMDB API has request limits in the free tier. If results stop loading, try again later or upgrade your API key.
Currently, favourites are not persistent across page reloads. You can improve this by using localStorage or a backend.

## ✨ Future Improvements**

1. Add a detailed movie info page
2. Store favourites in localStorage
3. Add loading indicators and error messages
4. Add pagination or infinite scroll to handle large result sets
